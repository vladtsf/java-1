# Lab01

There are four packages: "partA," "partB," "partC," and "lines."
Each of them contains my solutions for your assignments.
Assignments from the part B are mostly located in the "lines" package, which was a requirement.

I strove to supply tests that would cover the assigned requirements.
There are definitely cases that were not covered and may cause program failures.

I am pretty much sure there is nothing missing in the project.
I might have accidentally missed some part, though.
